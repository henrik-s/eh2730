\section{Quality attributes} 
\label{sec:quality_attributes}

This section will handle all of the \textbf{Quality attributes}, also called non-functional attributes.  In difference to section \ref{sec:3}-\ref{sec:4} that describe what the new system shall do, the quality attributes describe how the system shall be\cite {idi.ntnu}.  Quality attributes can i.e. describe uptime requirements, system architecture and security requirements.
Below, the \textbf{Quality attributes} for the WOMS system are listed. The requirements are categorized into security, safety, performance, reliability, availability, maintainability and interoperability
