\section{Functional requirements}
\label{sec:functional_requirements}

In this section, the functional requirements connected to each of the business processes listed in section \ref{sec:product_environment}. These functional requirements describe actions of the system, meaning what the system has to do or what functional needs the users will have when interacting with the WOMS. These requirements are prioritized according to the MoSCoW-model. 

\subsection{Planning Maintenance Work}
\label{sub:planning_maintenance_work}
In this section all the functional requirements connected to the business process \textbf{Planning Maintenance Work}, explained in section \ref{sec:bp1}, are listed. As stated in section \ref{sec:bp1}, these requirements are connected to the goal GOAL-1. The ID uniquely identifies the requirements in the format FR-PMW-\{number\}, where  FR stands for functional requirement and PMW stands for planning maintenance work.
